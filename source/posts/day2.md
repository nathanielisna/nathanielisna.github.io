# Four-Way Close Voicings
Today I spent like four hours creating music club slides on four part harmony... It took too much time than it should so i probably will have to figure out a more efficient way to write these slides. On the plus side, I was able to create really high quality slides and music files. 


## Slides
I started this by finding this video by the amazing Youtuber [Music With Myles](https://www.youtube.com/@MusicWithMyles). I really dig his videos as his videos are just top notch material and the speaking pace with the background beat is also amazing. I really hope to see more of his videos even though he had stopped posting for a while recently.

## Slides
These are the slides I will be presenting on 9/25/24. There are two parts in my slides, introduction to 7th chords then the the four-way close harmony. Here are my slides below.

          frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="true" mozallowfullscreen="true" webkitallowfullscreen="true"></iframe>

Here, I also created a SATB composition of Happy Birthday. One of the coolest features I found during my research for these slides was a software call [cantamus](https://cantamus.app/). This software can take written music and take MusicXML files with lyrics into voice audio files. This was so cool to play with and honestly a project I thought of doing since 7th grade. But anyways, I tossed my MusicXML file in here and I got this .wav audio file.

Pretty amazing right? Well, here's the [link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-Le1wlHmxzUchHt5sWooGhHy2hfWMF9r/view?usp=sharing) to the folder with the MusicXML and audio part files (soprano, alto, tenor, bass). Below I have embedded a SATB pdf version of Happy Birthday.
